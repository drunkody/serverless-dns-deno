Key Review Areas for Your CNAME Injector Plugin
🔒 Security & Validation

    Input sanitization: Domain normalization prevents injection attacks
    Configuration validation: Check if cname-rules.json can be externally modified
    Wildcard regex safety: Regex escaping prevents ReDoS attacks
    DNS response integrity: Ensure responses match DNS standards

⚡ Performance Impact

    Plugin positioning: Early placement (before commandControl) is correct for early exit
    Regex compilation: Multiple wildcards create new regexes on each query - consider caching compiled patterns
    Memory usage: JSON config loaded once, but rules object persists
    Response building: Packet construction efficiency

🛡️ Error Handling

    Config loading failures: Graceful degradation when JSON is invalid
    DNS encoding errors: Exception handling in packet building
    Plugin callback: Exception handling doesn't break the chain

🔧 Integration Concerns

    Context dependencies: Plugin requires rxid, requestDecodedDnsPacket, isDnsMsg
    Response format: Proper RResp structure for plugin chain
    Service registration: Proper initialization in service container

📋 Configuration Management

    Rule precedence: Exact matches before wildcards is correct
    IPv6 handling: Graceful null handling for missing AAAA records
    Runtime updates: No hot-reload capability for rule changes

🧪 Test Coverage Gaps

Your tests cover basic scenarios, but consider:

    Invalid DNS packet handling
    Multiple question packets
    Malformed configuration files
    Edge cases in wildcard matching
    IPv4/IPv6 combination scenarios

📊 Observability

    Logging levels: Good use of debug/info/error levels
    Metrics: Consider adding counters for matches/misses
    Request tracing: rxid tracking is consistent

🚨 Critical Issues to Watch

    DNS TTL: Fixed 300s TTL might be too long/short depending on use case
    Authoritative flag: flag_aa: false is correct for proxy responses
    Wildcard ordering: Ensure most specific patterns are checked first
    Memory leaks: Config reloading doesn't appear to clean up old rules

The implementation looks solid overall, with good separation of concerns and proper error handling.
